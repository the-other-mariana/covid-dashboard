# Data Stories

1. First, what we wanted to do in general was to tell a story to a specific **audience**: we imagined as if our dashboard was going to be consulted by people that want to research this pandemic. So, we decided to begin The Covid Story with how actually people that contracted Covid began their experience with this disease: Health Pre-conditions. Visualization number 1 therefore starts with the health status in which patients faced Covid. So we decided to make a bar chart where the user can choose the Health Condition to see: Tabaquism, Hypertension, etc, so that researchers have quite more detail about them. Also, we compared with a transition between men and health pre-conditions, because they can be of quite some use to people reasearching this disease.

2. Then, The Covid Story continues with the second visualization: Covid Cases Evolution during the first week of the disease. This is because, after knowing the health state of people **before** Covid, now researchers can see how this conditions actually *evolved* through time. For this we chose a circle chart animation through a 7 days timeline, so that the audience can perceive better what the numbers of new Covid cases actually meant. In this way, the circle radius and Y position represents the amount of new Covid cases, and their evolution changes with the X position. We also added the number of actual cases in each circle, because the audience needs **concrete** data if they are researching.
